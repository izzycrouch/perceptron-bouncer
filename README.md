## Overview 

You have been working in security at the North & Coders, one of the premier pubs in the city.

Unfortunately, the pub has been having problems with unruly customers. They've been making noise, smashing glasses, and disturbing local residents. Worse still, some are even suspected of writing JavaScript on the premises.
